    "> Q1. What are the three measures of central tendency?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Ans - Mean,median and mode.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are\n",
    "> they used to measure the central tendency of a dataset?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Ans - Mean: It is the average of all values in the dataset. It is\n",
    "> sensitive to outliers and works best with symmetrically distributed\n",
    "> data.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Median: It is the middle value when the dataset is arranged in\n",
    "> ascending or descending order. It is less affected by outliers and\n",
    "> suitable for skewed data.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Mode: It is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset.\n",
    "> It can be used with any type of data, including categorical data.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Each measure helps describe the central value of a dataset, and the\n",
    "> choice depends on the data's distribution and the presence of\n",
    "> outliers.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q3. Measure the three measures of central tendency for the given\n",
    "> height data:\n",
    "> \\[178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5\\]\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Ans - Mean: 177.77**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Median: 177**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Mode: 178**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **For the given height data, the mean height is approximately 177.77,\n",
    "> the median height is 177, and the mode is 178. These measures help\n",
    "> describe the central tendency of the dataset.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q4. Find the standard deviation for the given data:  \n",
    "> \\[178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5\\]  \n",
    "> **Ans - Standard deviation is 1.77**  \n",
    "> Q5. How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and\n",
    "> standard deviation used to describe the spread of a dataset? Provide\n",
    "> an example.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q6. What is a Venn diagram?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Ans - A Venn diagram is a graphical representation of sets using\n",
    "> overlapping circles or ellipses. It is used to show the relationships\n",
    "> and commonalities between different sets. Each circle in the diagram\n",
    "> represents a set, and the overlapping regions represent the elements\n",
    "> that belong to multiple sets. It helps visualize the intersections and\n",
    "> differences between sets and is commonly used in mathematics, logic,\n",
    "> statistics, and other fields to illustrate set theory concepts and\n",
    "> logical relationships.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q7. For the two given sets A = (2,3,4,5,6,7) & B = (0,2,6,8,10).\n",
    "> Find:  \n",
    "> (i) A B  \n",
    "> Ans - {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10\\]  \n",
    "> (ii) A ⋃ B  \n",
    "> Ans - A ⋃ B = {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Ans - Skewness in data refers to the asymmetry of the distribution.\n",
    "> It indicates whether the data is**  \n",
    "> **concentrated more on one side of the mean than the other. Positive\n",
    "> skewness means a longer tail on the right side, negative skewness\n",
    "> means a longer tail on the left side, and zero skewness indicates a\n",
    "> symmetrical distribution.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q9. If a data is right skewed then what will be the position of median\n",
    "> with respect to mean?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Ans - Mean \\< Median \\<Mode**  \n",
    "> Q10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How\n",
    "> are these measures used in statistical analysis?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q11. What is the formula for calculating the sample mean? Provide an\n",
    "> example calculation for a dataset.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Ans -  \n",
    "> **The formula for calculating the sample mean is:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Sample Mean (x̄ ) = Σx / n**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **where:**  \n",
    "> **x̄ = Sample mean**  \n",
    "> **Σx = Sum of all values in the dataset**  \n",
    "> **n = Number of values in the sample**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Example calculation:**  \n",
    "> **Let's calculate the sample mean for the following dataset:**  \n",
    "> **\\[12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25\\]**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Step 1: Add up all the values in the dataset.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Sum of the values (Σx) = 12 + 15 + 18 + 20 + 22 + 25 = 112**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Step 2: Count the number of values in the dataset (n).**  \n",
    "> **Number of values (n) = 6**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Step 3: Apply the formula for the sample mean.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Sample Mean (x̄ ) = Σx / n = 112 / 6 = 18.67**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **The sample mean for the given dataset is approximately 18.67.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q12. For a normal distribution data what is the relationship between\n",
    "> its measure of central tendency?\n",
