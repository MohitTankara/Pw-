    "> Q1. What is Statistics?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Ans -**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Statistics, in short, is the field of study that involves\n",
    "> collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.\n",
    "> It provides tools and techniques to make sense of information, draw\n",
    "> conclusions, and make informed decisions in various fields, such as\n",
    "> science, economics, social sciences, and more. Statistics helps us\n",
    "> understand patterns, trends, and relationships within data, enabling\n",
    "> us to make predictions and test hypotheses about the world around\n",
    "> us.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of\n",
    "> when each type might be used.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Ans - Sure, in short, there are two main types of statistics:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **1 -Descriptive Statistics:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Definition: Descriptive statistics involve summarizing and\n",
    "> describing data to understand its main features, such as central\n",
    "> tendency, variability, and distribution.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Example: A survey collects data on the heights of a group of people.\n",
    "> Descriptive statistics are used to calculate the average height, the\n",
    "> range of heights, and the most common height, providing a clear\n",
    "> overview of the data.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **2 - Inferential Statistics:**  \n",
    "> **Definition: Inferential statistics involve drawing conclusions or\n",
    "> making predictions about a larger population based on a sample of\n",
    "> data, using probability and hypothesis testing.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Example: A political poll surveys a random sample of voters to\n",
    "> predict the winner of an upcoming election. Inferential statistics are\n",
    "> used to estimate the overall voter preferences and make projections\n",
    "> about the election outcome for the entire population of voter**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from\n",
    "> each other? Provide an example of each type of data.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Ans - there are two types of data**  \n",
    "> **(1) Qualitative data also called numerical data**  \n",
    "> **In qualitative data there are subtypes**  \n",
    "> **(1) discrete or integer**  \n",
    "> **For ex 1,2,4,5**  \n",
    "> **(2)- continuous or float**  \n",
    "> **Ex- 242.475,5.11**  \n",
    "> **(2) Quantitative data also called categorical data**  \n",
    "> **In quantitative data there are also subtypes just like**  \n",
    "> Q4. Categorise the following datasets with respect to quantitative and\n",
    "> qualitative data types: (i) Grading in exam: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D,\n",
    "> E  \n",
    "> **Ans - Qualitative data**  \n",
    "> Subtype - ordinal data\n",
    ">\n",
    "> \\(ii\\) Colour of mangoes: yellow, green, orange, red  \n",
    "> **Ans - Qualitative data**  \n",
    "> Subtype - nominal\n",
    ">\n",
    "> \\(iii\\) Height data of a class: \\[178.9, 179, 179.5, 176, 177.2,\n",
    "> 178.3, 175.8,...\\]\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Ans - Quantitative data**  \n",
    "> Subtype - continuous data or float\n",
    ">\n",
    "> \\(iv\\) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: \\[500, 600, 478, 672, â€¦\\]\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Ans - Quantitative data**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Subtype - discrete or integer\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q5. Explain the concept of levels of measurement and give an example\n",
    "> of a variable for each level.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when\n",
    "> analyzing data? Provide an example to illustrate your answer.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q7. How nominal data type is different from ordinal data type.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Ans - Nominal Data:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **1-Represents categories or groups.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **2- No inherent order or ranking among categories.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **3 - Examples: Colors, types of fruits, gender, marital status.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Ordinal Data:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **1- Represents categories with a natural order or ranking.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **2 - Differences between categories are not quantifiable.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **3 - Examples: Ranks (1st place, 2nd place, etc.), educational\n",
    "> levels, Likert scales (e.g., satisfaction levels).**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q8. Which type of plot can be used to display data in terms of range?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q9. Describe the difference between descriptive and inferential\n",
    "> statistics. Give an example of each type of statistics and explain how\n",
    "> they are used.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Ans - Descriptive statistics summarizes and describes data,\n",
    "> providing a clear and concise representation of its main features\n",
    "> (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation). It is used to understand the\n",
    "> data's characteristics and patterns.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Example: Calculating the average age of a group of individuals.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Inferential statistics draws conclusions or makes predictions about\n",
    "> a population based on a sample of data. It uses probability and\n",
    "> hypothesis testing to generalize findings to a larger group.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Example: Conducting a survey with a random sample of voters to\n",
    "> predict election results for the entire population.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **In short, descriptive statistics describe data, while inferential\n",
    "> statistics make predictions about a larger population based on a\n",
    "> sample.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability\n",
    "> used in statistics? Explain how each measure can be used to describe a\n",
    "> dataset.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Note: Create your assignment in Jupyter notebook and upload it in\n",
    "> GitHub & share that github repository\n",
    ">\n",
    "> link through your dashboard. Make sure the repository is public.\n",
