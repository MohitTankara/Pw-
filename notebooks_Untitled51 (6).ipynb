        "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which a computer algorithm learns to make predictions or decisions based on labeled data. Labeled data is made up of previously known input variables (also known as features) and output variables (also known as labels). By analyzing patterns and relationships between input and output variables in labeled data, the algorithm learns to make predictions. Image and speech recognition, recommendation systems, and fraud detection are all examples of how supervised learning is used. The examples below will help explain what supervised learning is. 1- Voice Recognition 2- Email Filtering"
